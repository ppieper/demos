MyMeal is a web application for managing food inventory, recipes, grocery lists, and meal suggestions, as well as a platform to discover new recipes based on the contents of your inventory. 

Most of my work was mainly focused on the latter aspect. [source code](https://github.com/ToniTurri/MyMeal)
