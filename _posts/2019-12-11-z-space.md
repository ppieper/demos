This is a demo of Z-Space, a game built in Unity using C#. Give it some time to load as it is downloading the 3d assets and textures. For the best experience, play in fullscreen mode.
[source code](https://github.com/ppieper/Z-Space)

Controls: Left + right click to fire weapons, wasd for movement, hold tab to use scanner. Esc for menu/pause. 

Hint: You're an interstellar bounty hunter looking for Dirty Dan, the most wanted criminal in this sector of space. See if you can find and eliminate him! 
There are other smaller bounties to collect as well.
